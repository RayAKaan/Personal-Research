The United Nations Secretary-General emphasized that this decade is decisive for preventing catastrophic warming. Over 150 countries pledged new commitments to reduce carbon emissions by 50% before 2030. The summit highlighted renewable energy breakthroughs, with solar costs dropping 80% since 2020. However, developing nations demanded $500 billion in climate finance from wealthy countries. Scientists warned that current pledges still fall short of limiting warming to 1.5°C.\"\"\",\n",

China revealed plans to phase out coal power by 2035, a surprising acceleration of previous targets. The United States pledged to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2032. Tech giants including Microsoft, Apple, and Google announced carbon-negative operations by 2027. Climate activists staged massive protests, demanding faster action and fossil fuel phase-outs.\"\"\",\n",
        "            \"\"\"The summit's final agreement includes binding emissions targets and transparency mechanisms. Countries must submit detailed reduction plans by March 2026. A new global carbon pricing mechanism will launch in January 2027. Deforestation will be penalized through international trade restrictions. Climate finance for vulnerable nations increased to $200 billion annually. Youth delegates secured representation in all future climate negotiations, a historic first.\"\"\"\n",
